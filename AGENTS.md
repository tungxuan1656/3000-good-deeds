# Root AGENTS Guide

This file defines the default working conventions for contributors in this monorepo.

## Scope

Applies to the whole repository unless a package-level `AGENTS.md` provides more specific rules.

- Frontend-specific rules: `frontend/AGENTS.md`
- Backend-specific rules: `backend/AGENTS.md`

## Core Principles

- Keep changes small, clear, and reviewable.
- Preserve API and behavior compatibility unless a breaking change is explicitly approved.
- Keep docs synchronized with code changes.
- Prefer consistency with existing project patterns over personal style preferences.

## Documentation Rules

- Shared docs belong in `docs/`.
- Frontend-only docs belong in `frontend/docs/`.
- Backend-only docs belong in `backend/docs/`.
- For fullstack features, follow: `docs/governance/fullstack-feature-development-process.md`.

## Quality Gates

Before marking work as done:

- Run relevant lint/type checks.
- Validate changed user flows manually when needed.
- Update docs affected by API, schema, architecture, or behavior changes.
- Ensure links in modified docs remain valid.

## Security Basics

- Never commit secrets or credentials.
- Do not log sensitive data (tokens, personal data, private content).
- Use environment variables for all secret configuration.

# GitNexus — Code Intelligence

This project is indexed by GitNexus as **3000-good-deeds** (1591 symbols, 2778 relationships, 26 execution flows). Use the GitNexus MCP tools to understand code, assess impact, and navigate safely.

> If any GitNexus tool warns the index is stale, run `npx gitnexus analyze` in terminal first.

## Always Do

- **MUST run impact analysis before editing any symbol.** Before modifying a function, class, or method, run `gitnexus_impact({target: "symbolName", direction: "upstream"})` and report the blast radius (direct callers, affected processes, risk level) to the user.
- **MUST run `gitnexus_detect_changes()` before committing** to verify your changes only affect expected symbols and execution flows.
- **MUST warn the user** if impact analysis returns HIGH or CRITICAL risk before proceeding with edits.
- When exploring unfamiliar code, use `gitnexus_query({query: "concept"})` to find execution flows instead of grepping. It returns process-grouped results ranked by relevance.
- When you need full context on a specific symbol — callers, callees, which execution flows it participates in — use `gitnexus_context({name: "symbolName"})`.

## When Debugging

1. `gitnexus_query({query: "<error or symptom>"})` — find execution flows related to the issue
2. `gitnexus_context({name: "<suspect function>"})` — see all callers, callees, and process participation
3. `READ gitnexus://repo/3000-good-deeds/process/{processName}` — trace the full execution flow step by step
4. For regressions: `gitnexus_detect_changes({scope: "compare", base_ref: "main"})` — see what your branch changed

## When Refactoring

- **Renaming**: MUST use `gitnexus_rename({symbol_name: "old", new_name: "new", dry_run: true})` first. Review the preview — graph edits are safe, text_search edits need manual review. Then run with `dry_run: false`.
- **Extracting/Splitting**: MUST run `gitnexus_context({name: "target"})` to see all incoming/outgoing refs, then `gitnexus_impact({target: "target", direction: "upstream"})` to find all external callers before moving code.
- After any refactor: run `gitnexus_detect_changes({scope: "all"})` to verify only expected files changed.

## Never Do

- NEVER edit a function, class, or method without first running `gitnexus_impact` on it.
- NEVER ignore HIGH or CRITICAL risk warnings from impact analysis.
- NEVER rename symbols with find-and-replace — use `gitnexus_rename` which understands the call graph.
- NEVER commit changes without running `gitnexus_detect_changes()` to check affected scope.

## Tools Quick Reference

| Tool             | When to use                   | Command                                                                 |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `query`          | Find code by concept          | `gitnexus_query({query: "auth validation"})`                            |
| `context`        | 360-degree view of one symbol | `gitnexus_context({name: "validateUser"})`                              |
| `impact`         | Blast radius before editing   | `gitnexus_impact({target: "X", direction: "upstream"})`                 |
| `detect_changes` | Pre-commit scope check        | `gitnexus_detect_changes({scope: "staged"})`                            |
| `rename`         | Safe multi-file rename        | `gitnexus_rename({symbol_name: "old", new_name: "new", dry_run: true})` |
| `cypher`         | Custom graph queries          | `gitnexus_cypher({query: "MATCH ..."})`                                 |

## Impact Risk Levels

| Depth | Meaning                               | Action                |
| ----- | ------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| d=1   | WILL BREAK — direct callers/importers | MUST update these     |
| d=2   | LIKELY AFFECTED — indirect deps       | Should test           |
| d=3   | MAY NEED TESTING — transitive         | Test if critical path |

## Resources

| Resource                                         | Use for                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| `gitnexus://repo/3000-good-deeds/context`        | Codebase overview, check index freshness |
| `gitnexus://repo/3000-good-deeds/clusters`       | All functional areas                     |
| `gitnexus://repo/3000-good-deeds/processes`      | All execution flows                      |
| `gitnexus://repo/3000-good-deeds/process/{name}` | Step-by-step execution trace             |

## Self-Check Before Finishing

Before completing any code modification task, verify:
1. `gitnexus_impact` was run for all modified symbols
2. No HIGH/CRITICAL risk warnings were ignored
3. `gitnexus_detect_changes()` confirms changes match expected scope
4. All d=1 (WILL BREAK) dependents were updated

## Keeping the Index Fresh

After committing code changes, the GitNexus index becomes stale. Re-run analyze to update it:

```bash
npx gitnexus analyze
```

If the index previously included embeddings, preserve them by adding `--embeddings`:

```bash
npx gitnexus analyze --embeddings
```

To check whether embeddings exist, inspect `.gitnexus/meta.json` — the `stats.embeddings` field shows the count (0 means no embeddings). **Running analyze without `--embeddings` will delete any previously generated embeddings.**
